Trying to create some reusable components for hyprtoolkit.
Hyprtoolkit allows to create Hyprland Native apps.
Eventually will try to create apps for hyprland.

NB: Hyprtoolkit is very minimal, hence it is actually a crazy plan to make apps for it. However simple apps are easy.
1. Launcher : Download the file launcher/build/launcher and open it. Works. Esc to close, Conrol Esc to switch betwen List and Grid.
2. Button Drop down, TOplayer, Teditor are just for testing.
3. Grid is resusable grid layout with boxes in that grid.
4. Searchview is reusable searchview.
5. grid-search tests  combining grid and search: Currrently working on this. Although Launcher already works, but we are trying this way for optimization.
